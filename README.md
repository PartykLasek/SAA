A simple Python application that performs sentiment analysis on user-provided text using the VADER sentiment analysis model from the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK).

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of input text. The VADER sentiment analysis model is employed to determine whether the text is positive, negative, or neutral.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git
    cd sentiment-analysis
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install nltk
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python sentiment_analysis.py
    ```

5. Enter a sentence or phrase when prompted.
6. The application will output the sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

## Dependencies

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

## Notes

- The VADER lexicon is downloaded automatically the first time you run the application.
- This is a basic example; you can extend and customize the project based on your preferences and needs.
- Consider adding a user interface or integrating with other services for a more comprehensive application.
